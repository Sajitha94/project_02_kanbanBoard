## 📝 Project Description

The **Kanban Board** is a web-based task management application built with **React** and **Material-UI**, inspired by the Kanban methodology. It allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks efficiently by moving them across different columns representing their status:

- **To Do** – Tasks that are yet to be started.
- **In Progress** – Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Done** – Completed tasks.

This project showcases a responsive, drag-and-drop interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices, with persistent task storage using the browser's **localStorage**.
